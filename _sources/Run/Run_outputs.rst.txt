FitSNAP Outputs
===============

FitSNAP outputs include error metrics, detailed errors for each atom, configuration, or groups of 
configurations, and LAMMPS-ready files for running MD simulations.

Outputs are different for linear and nonlinear models. 

For linear models, please see the `Linear models output section <../Linear.html#outputs>`__

For nonlinear models, please see the
`PyTorch models output section <../Pytorch.html#outputs-and-error-calculation>`__.
